The aim of this project was to find out the total amount from image file of any invoice. To solve this [Tesseract OCR](https://opensource.google/projects/tesseract) has been used to convert the image of the invoice into string fromat and then the total amount is extracted using regex. This is implemented using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
